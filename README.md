Command line application that monitorizes the exit status of a _check command_ and, in case of failure, runs another _main command_. Optionally it can monitor that the provided _main command_ is permanently running, triggering a restart (kill & run) if _check command_ fails.

Primarily intended for checking if network is reachable (direct tcp connection or ping), current releases can do much more with the addition of **custom check and kill commands.**

Proudly made from Barcelona with Rust ðŸ¦€.

## How does it work?

![Flow Chart][flowchart-image]

## Installation

Three options:

### Cargo & Go

1.  If you already have `cargo` installed, use:

        cargo install pingkeeper

### Manual download

1.  Download release binaries from [releases page][releases-link].

1.  Check the integrity of the downloaded file _(version may differ)_:

        sha512sum --check pingkeeper-macos-v3.2.0.tar.gz.sha512

    It should say: `pingkeeper-macos-v3.2.0.tar.gz: OK`

1.  Extract archive _(version may differ)_ with:

        tar xvf pingkeeper-macos-v3.2.0.tar.gz

1.  Check the integrity of the binary file with:

        sha512sum --check pingkeeper.sha512

    It should say: `pingkeeper: OK`

1.  Copy `pingkeeper` binary file to somewhere within your `$PATH`, ie: `/usr/local/bin`.

### Build it yourself

This requires the stable version of `rust` & `cargo` installed. Visit [Rust website][rust-link] for more information.

1.  Run this command:

        cargo build --release

2.  You will find your executable at `./target/release/pingkeeper`.

## Usage

### Usage examples

- Keep your vpn connection alive using OpenVPN:

  ```shell
  sudo pingkeeper -k "openvpn /home/user/vpn_configuration.ovpn"
  ```

- Keep your vpn connection alive using [Hummingbird][hummingbird-link] without any logging:

  ```shell
  sudo pingkeeper --keep-alive --quiet "hummingbird denmark.ovpn"
  ```

- Send an email to your boss when your network is down, using ping as test:

  ```shell
  pingkeeper --use-ping "mail -s \"Sorry, my network is down. I will be right back asap.\" myboss@example.com < /dev/null"
  ```

- Send yourself a [pushbullet-cli][pushbullet-cli-link] message when your home server seems down, using ping as test:

  ```shell
  pingkeeper --hosts "192.168.1.50" --use-ping "pb push \"Is home server down?\""
  ```

- Tweet when your [opentracker][opentracker-link] bittorrent tracker server seems down, using [t][t-link]:

  ```shell
  pingkeeper --hosts "10.1.1.28:6969" "t update \"Dear users, the tracker is currently down :(\""
  ```

- Run your own script when the damn wifi seems down again:

  ```shell
  pingkeeper "/home/user/try_reset_router.sh"
  ```

- Shutdown server when the canary file is missing:

  ```shell
  sudo pingkeeper --check-cmd "cat /root/canary.txt" --kill-cmd "echo" "shutdown -h now"
  ```

### Usage manual

Help available running `pingkeeper --help`:

```

USAGE:
    pingkeeper [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help
            Prints help information

    -k, --keep-alive
            Keep <COMMAND> alive.

            Run <COMMAND> on start, also restart it when it dies.
    -q, --quiet
            Do not output anything from <COMMAND> output, also reduces `-v` by one

    -P, --use-ping
            Use `ping` to check connection.

            Use system's `ping` command to check network connection.
    -V, --version
            Prints version information

    -v
            Verbosity, -v -vv -vvv.

            Log levels: 0 = error, 1 = warning, 2 = info, 3 = debug.

OPTIONS:
        --check-cmd <check-cmd>
            Use custom command to check

            Check network or something else. This will trigger the execution / kill flow as if it was a network check.
            Example: --check-cmd "cat canary.txt"
    -H, --hosts <hosts>
            Space separated list of addresses or hosts (ping).

            For direct connection: List of IPv4 and IPv6, with or without port.

            For ping: List of hosts.

            Order does not matter, list will be shuffled. [default: 8.8.8.8 8.8.6.6 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1]
        --kill-cmd <kill-cmd>
            Use custom command to kill

            Example: --kill-cmd "echo \"My baby shot me down\" >> bang_bang.log"
    -m, --max-errors <max-errors>
            Maximum number of <COMMAND> errors in a row.

            0 for infinite. Only used by `--keep-alive`. [default: 0]
    -n, --network-every <n>
            Network check delay, in seconds.

            Check network again after this amount of seconds from the latest success. [default: 5]
        --ping-opt <opts>
            Options for `ping` command, requires `--use-ping` [default: -c1]

    -p, --port <port>
            Default port to connect, ignored if `--use-ping`.

            Port to connect if host does not have a port specified. [default: 53]
    -w, --wait-after-exec <seconds>
            Execution delay, in seconds.

            Seconds to check network for the first time after executing <COMMAND>. [default: 5]
    -s, --signal <signal>
            Signal to kill <COMMAND>.

            Could be any unix signal: `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, etc. [default: SIGINT]
    -t, --timeout <timeout>
            Timeout in seconds, ignored if `--use-ping` [default: 2]


ARGS:
    <COMMAND>
