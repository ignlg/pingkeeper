# pingkeeper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ignlg/pingkeeper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ignlg/pingkeeper)
[![Latest version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/online.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/online)
![Stability stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-stable-green.svg)

Command line application that monitorises that network is reachable (direct tcp connection or ping) and, in case of failure, runs a command. Optionally it can monitor that the command is permanently running and restart it if network is unreachable.

Proudly made from Barcelona with Rust ðŸ¦€.

## How does it work?

![Flow Chart](assets/Pingkeeper-flowchart.png)

## Installation

Three options:

### Cargo & Go

1.  If you already have `cargo` installed, use:

        cargo install pingkeeper

### Manual download

1.  Download release binaries from [releases page](https://github.com/ignlg/pingkeeper/releases).

1.  _recommended_ Check the integrity of the downloaded file:

        sha512sum --check pingkeeper-macos-v3.0.0.tar.gz.sha512

    It should say: `pingkeeper-macos-v3.0.0.tar.gz: OK`

1.  Extract archive with:

        tar xvf pingkeeper-macos-v3.0.0.tar.gz

1.  _recommended_ Check the integrity of the binary file with:

        sha512sum --check pingkeeper.sha512

    It should say: `pingkeeper: OK`

1.  Copy `pingkeeper` binary file to somewhere within your `$PATH`, ie: `/usr/local/bin`.

### Build it yourself

This requires the stable version of `rust` & `cargo` installed. Visit [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for more information.

1.  Run this command:

        cargo build --release

2.  You will find your executable at `./target/release/pingkeeper`.

## Usage

### Usage examples

- Keep your connection alive using OpenVPN:

        sudo pingkeeper -k "openvpn /home/user/vpn_configuration.ovpn"

* Keep your connection alive using Hummingbird without any logging:

        sudo pingkeeper --keep-alive --quite "hummingbird /home/user/vpn_configuration.ovpn"

* Send an email to your boss when your network is down, using ping as test:

        pingkeeper --use-ping "mail -s \"Sorry, my network is down. I will be right back asap.\" myboss@example.com < /dev/null"

                --wait-after-exec <seconds>
                Seconds to check ping after executing command [default: 5]

        -s, --signal <signal>
                Signal to end command on command restart: `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, etc [default: SIGINT]

        -t, --timeout <timeout>
