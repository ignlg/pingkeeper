Command line application that monitorises that network is reachable (direct tcp connection or ping) and, in case of failure, runs a command. Optionally it can monitor that the command is permanently running and restart it if network is unreachable.

Proudly made from Barcelona with Rust ðŸ¦€.

## How does it work?

![Flow Chart][flowchart-image]

## Installation

Three options:

### Cargo & Go

1.  If you already have `cargo` installed, use:

        cargo install pingkeeper

### Manual download

1.  Download release binaries from [releases page][releases-link].

1.  _recommended_ Check the integrity of the downloaded file:

        sha512sum --check pingkeeper-macos-v3.0.0.tar.gz.sha512

    It should say: `pingkeeper-macos-v3.0.0.tar.gz: OK`

1.  Extract archive with:

        tar xvf pingkeeper-macos-v3.0.0.tar.gz

1.  _recommended_ Check the integrity of the binary file with:

        sha512sum --check pingkeeper.sha512

    It should say: `pingkeeper: OK`

1.  Copy `pingkeeper` binary file to somewhere within your `$PATH`, ie: `/usr/local/bin`.

### Build it yourself

This requires the stable version of `rust` & `cargo` installed. Visit [Rust website][rust-link] for more information.

1.  Run this command:

        cargo build --release

2.  You will find your executable at `./target/release/pingkeeper`.

## Usage

### Usage examples

- Keep your vpn connection alive using OpenVPN:

  ```shell
  sudo pingkeeper -k "openvpn /home/user/vpn_configuration.ovpn"
  ```

- Keep your vpn connection alive using [Hummingbird][hummingbird-link] without any logging:

  ```shell
  sudo pingkeeper --keep-alive --quite "hummingbird denmark.ovpn"
  ```

- Send an email to your boss when your network is down, using ping as test:

  ```shell
  pingkeeper --use-ping "mail -s \"Sorry, my network is down. I will be right back asap.\" myboss@example.com < /dev/null"
  ```

- Send yourself a [pushbullet-cli][pushbullet-cli-link] message when your home server seems down, using ping as test:

  ```shell
  pingkeeper --hosts "192.168.1.50" --use-ping "pb push \"Is home server down?\""
  ```

- Tweet when your [opentracker][opentracker-link] bittorrent tracker server seems down, using [t][t-link]:

  ```shell
  pingkeeper --hosts "10.1.1.28" --port 6969 "t update \"Dear users, the tracker is currently down :(\""
  ```

- Run your own script when the damn wifi seems down again:

  ```shell
  pingkeeper "/home/user/try_reset_router.sh"
  ```
